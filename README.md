Diabetes Risk Analysis & Patient Health Insights

Project Overview

Diabetes is a growing global health concern, and early identification of high-risk individuals is critical for prevention and cost-effective care.
This project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics use case, where a Data Analyst supports doctors, hospitals, and insurance providers by identifying high-risk diabetic profiles and delivering actionable insights through data-driven dashboards.
The analysis focuses on patient demographics, clinical indicators, and family history to build a risk profiling framework for early screening and targeted intervention.

Business Problem Statement

•	Predict high-risk diabetic patient profiles to enable targeted preventive clinical interventions.
•	Reduce late-stage diagnosis by identifying critical patient segments using data analytics.
•	Support healthcare decision-makers with clear, actionable insights for screening and outreach programs.

Project Objectives

This project addresses the problem through four key analytical pillars:
1.	Demographic Risk Segmentation
o	Categorize patient populations by Age Group and BMI Category
o	Identify demographics with the highest diabetes prevalence
2.	Clinical Indicator Impact Analysis
o	Quantify the impact of Glucose Levels and Family History on diabetes diagnosis
o	Assess their relative importance in risk modelling
3.	Critical Zone Identification
o	Isolate patients who are both Obese and High-Glucose
o	Prioritize them for immediate medical outreach
4.	Top Risk Profile Development
o	Combine multiple risk factors into composite risk profiles
o	Enable early screening and preventive care strategies

Research Questions

•	What is the diabetes rate by age group?
•	How does BMI category influence diabetes prevalence?
•	What is the impact of glucose levels on diagnosis?
•	Who qualifies as high-risk patients?
•	How many patients fall into the Obese + High Glucose category?
•	What role does family history play in diabetes risk?
•	What are the Top Risk Profiles based on multi-factor analysis?

Tools & Skills Used

Tools
•	Python – Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering
•	MS SQL Server – Data querying, aggregations, analytical analysis
•	Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards
 Skills
•	Healthcare analytics
•	Risk analysis & segmentation
•	Data visualization & storytelling
•	Business insights generation

Architecture Flow

 CSV Data → Python (Cleaning & EDA) → MS SQL (Analysis) → Power BI   (Dashboard & Insights)

 Key Dashboards & Analysis 
 
• Diabetes Rate by Age Group
•	Diabetes Rate by BMI Category
•	Glucose Level Impact on diagnosis
•	Identification of High-Risk Patients
•	Obese + High Glucose (Critical Zone) analysis
•	Family History Impact
•	Top Risk Profiles using multi-factor scoring

Business Recommendations

1.	Tiered Screening Strategy
o	Mandate bi-annual glucose screenings for high-risk individuals
o	Example: Patients over 40 years with BMI > 30
2.	Automated Red Flag Alerts
o	Integrate alerts into Patient Management Systems
o	Automatically flag Obese + High Glucose patients for immediate consultation with:
	Nutritionists
	Endocrinologists
3.	Legacy Health Initiative
o	Target children and relatives of diabetic patients
o	Offer subsidized preventive wellness packages, including:
	Lifestyle coaching
	Baseline health screenings
4.	Wearable & CGM Integration
o	Partner with wearable tech / CGM providers
o	Use real-time glucose data to send dietary and lifestyle nudges via mobile apps

 Project Outcomes
 
•	Clear identification of high-risk diabetic populations
•	Actionable insights for preventive healthcare planning
•	Scalable risk profiling framework for early screening
•	End-to-end analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI
